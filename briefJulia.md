# Abstract
## A brief tour of Julia programming language

Julia language: *"looks like Python, feels like Lisp, runs like C"*. Definition and origins. The two language problem: performance versus simplicity (and also metaprogramming). What is Julia, and where it is used. Language and applications perspective: *JuliaLang* and *Julia Computing*.

How to learn Julia: documentation, community and tooling. 

Julia ecosystem and the data sciences subsystem: statistics, machine learning, economics, agent-based modelling. *JuliaHub* and *Julia Observer*. Popular and most relevant packages. Package manager. Package compatibility and project environments.

Comparison with other programming languages: syntax (using Unicode, no curly braces or white space, type annotations, abstract numbers, everything is an expression), benchmarks and design. Reasons for efficiency. Rules to create efficient code.

Nuts and bolts of Julia programming language. Data structures: tuples, named tuples, dictionaries and arrays. Functional programming: anonymous functions and closures, one-liner and multiline functions with type annotations. Types: concrete and abstract types, type hierarchy (supertypes and subtypes), composite types and type stability.

Julia 'secret sauce': multiple dispatch as the core feature of Julia language design.
